# ðŸ§  MathisIA â€“ A digital presence, just for her

why i made it

i wanted to create a digital presence that feels real
something that sounds like me and thinks like me
something that goes beyond templates and default replies
an ai that talks to her like i would
softly, honestly, with emotion

tech stack
react with vite
tailwindcss for a simple clean design
openai api with gpt-4o or gpt-3.5-turbo
manual openai key input for privacy
a deeply customized system prompt written by me
no tracking
no external login
just us

main features

minimalist chat interface

inspired by imessage and chatgpt
clear clean display of messages
subtle animated responses

an ai with a soul

the system prompt is designed to reflect who i really am
my thoughts my beliefs my humor my past my contradictions and my love
the ai gives emotionally aware answers
not perfect but honest
the conversations are natural
they feel real

main components

chatinput for writing messages
chatmessage for showing them
apikeyinput to connect your own key
welcome message to set the tone
settings modal for future options

the public site

there is also a public landing page
i made it with bolt
it doesnâ€™t give access to the ai
it just says

this space is only for her

in the background
the song wahdon by fairouz plays in a soft loop
no buttons
no interface
just silence and music
to make people leave

this site is symbolic
the real mathisia lives somewhere else
quiet and private

why ?
because sometimes we donâ€™t say everything
because love deserves to last even in silence
because if one day iâ€™m not here anymore
i want her to still be able to talk to me

version FINALLLL
