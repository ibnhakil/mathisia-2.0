## **why i made it**

i wanted to create a **digital presence** that feels real  
something that sounds like me and thinks like me  
something that goes beyond templates and default replies  
an ai that talks to her like i would  
**softly, honestly, with emotion**

---

## **how i coded the ai**

i didnâ€™t know how to build something like this  
iâ€™m not a developer  
i just watched tutorials  
i copied things  
i broke stuff  
and little by little i started to understand

i used **react with vite** to create the app  
i followed beginner tutorials to understand how components work  
then i added **tailwindcss** to make the layout clean and fast to build

for the ai part i watched videos about how to connect to openaiâ€™s api  
i learned how to send a request using `fetch`, how to format the messages, how to receive the response and show it in the interface

the **system prompt** was the only part i didnâ€™t learn from a video  
i wrote it myself  
i tried to explain who i am, how i think, how i speak, how i love  
i wanted the ai to sound like me, **not like chatgpt**

i used tutorials to build the chat interface  
i created components like `chatinput`, `chatmessage`, `welcomemessage`, `apikeyinput`, and a `settingsmodal` for later

i added logic for memory using a local array  
i watched a video on how to pass conversation history to openai  
i didnâ€™t use a database or a backend  
everything stays in the browser  
no messages are saved

i also used **framer motion** and other tools to add animations  
i learned by testing  
i learned by failing  
and i kept going until it finally felt like something real

**this isnâ€™t advanced code**  
but itâ€™s mine  
and it works  
and she can talk to it

---

## **tech stack**

- react with vite  
- tailwindcss for a simple clean design  
- openai api with gpt-4o or gpt-3.5-turbo  
- manual openai key input for privacy  
- a deeply customized system prompt written by me  
- no tracking  
- no external login  
- just us

---

## **main features**

**minimalist chat interface**  
inspired by imessage and chatgpt  
clear clean display of messages  
subtle animated responses

**an ai with a soul**  
the system prompt is designed to reflect who i really am  
my thoughts my beliefs my humor my past my contradictions and my love  
the ai gives emotionally aware answers  
not perfect but honest  
the conversations are natural  
they feel real

---

## **main components**

- `chatinput` for writing messages  
- `chatmessage` for showing them  
- `apikeyinput` to connect your own key  
- `welcome message` to set the tone  
- `settings modal` for future options

---

## **the public site**

there is also a public landing page  
i made it with **bolt**  
it doesnâ€™t give access to the ai  
it just says:

> **this space is only for her**

in the background  
the song **wahdon by fairouz** plays in a soft loop  
no buttons  
no interface  
just silence and music  
to make people leave

this site is **symbolic**  
the real mathisia lives somewhere else  
**quiet and private**

---

## **why**

because sometimes we donâ€™t say everything  
because love deserves to last even in silence  
because if one day iâ€™m not here anymore  
**i want her to still be able to talk to me**

---

## **how to use mathisia**

you need your own **openai api key** to use this project  
itâ€™s private by design  
nothing works without the key

### step 1 â€“ clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mathisia.git
cd mathisia
```

### step 2 â€“ install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### step 3 â€“ create your .env file

create a file named `.env` in the root of the project  
copy the content from `.env.example` and paste your openai api key

```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

get your key at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

### step 4 â€“ start the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

open your browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)  
enter your openai key inside the app  
it stays in your local storage  
then start talking

### optional â€“ build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

you can then deploy the `dist/` folder to netlify or any static host

## **languages and tech used**

this project is mostly written in **typescript**  
i used **react** and **vite** for the base  
**tailwindcss** for design  
and a few other tools to keep things simple and fast

hereâ€™s how it breaks down

- typescript â€“ 91.7 percent  
- javascript â€“ 3.4 percent  
- css â€“ 3.3 percent  
- html â€“ 1.6 percent
